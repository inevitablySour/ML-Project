# ML-Project

Step 1. Business Understanding

Goal: Understand CAICLE’s needs and define the machine learning problem clearly.
Tasks:

Identify what “future race performance” means in measurable terms (e.g., race placement, finishing time, probability of finishing in top 10).

Define success criteria (e.g., acceptable prediction error, business usefulness).

Summarize the client’s goals and the impact on CAICLE’s rider selection strategy.
Responsibilities:

Translate the business problem into an ML target.

Write up the business problem and success criteria.

Research similar problems in sports analytics and summarize findings.

Step 2. Data Understanding

Goal: Explore the provided race result dataset.
Tasks:

Inspect the structure of the data (rows, columns, variable types).

Identify missing values, inconsistencies, or unusual patterns.

Produce descriptive statistics and simple visualizations.
Responsibilities:

Load and explore the dataset.

Summarize the main observations in text and visuals.

Create charts or tables that highlight data quality and patterns.

Step 3. Data Preparation (Main Focus Area)

Goal: Prepare the dataset for modeling.
Tasks:

Data Selection: Decide which features are relevant and document reasons for inclusion/exclusion.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summarize key findings and patterns, supported by visualizations.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and errors.

Specialization Topic: Choose one (data cleaning/imputation, dimensionality reduction, or outlier detection). Conduct research and propose methods for applying it to the dataset.

Responsibilities:

Implement cleaning and preprocessing steps.

Generate visualizations and summary statistics for EDA.

Research methods relevant to the chosen specialization topic and document a detailed plan for implementation.

Prepare an interim presentation with data preparation results and the specialization topic deep dive.

Deliverables:

Cleaned dataset ready for modeling.

Documented EDA results with visuals.

Detailed specialization topic report.

Interim presentation for week 7.

Step 4. Modelling

Goal: Build and test machine learning models.
Tasks:

Select suitable algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

Design test methodology (train/test split, cross-validation).

Train and evaluate models using appropriate performance metrics (e.g., RMSE for regression, accuracy/F1 for classification).
Responsibilities:

Implement and train models.

Collect and summarize performance metrics.

Research and document algorithm characteristics, advantages, and limitations.

Design a testing strategy and interpret results.

Step 5. Evaluation

Goal: Evaluate and optimize the chosen models.
Tasks:

Perform hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search, random search).

Assess robustness and generalizability of models.

Compare results against business success criteria.

Determine which model(s) best meet CAICLE’s goals.

Responsibilities:

Conduct model optimization and record results.

Summarize performance comparison in tables or charts.

Provide a business-focused explanation of model effectiveness and robustness.

Step 6. Deployment & Presentation

Goal: Deliver a prototype and present results to CAICLE.
Tasks:

Build a pipeline from data input to prediction.

Prepare the final report and presentation.

Present results and explain the reasoning behind all choices.

Responsibilities:

Implement the pipeline and demo its functionality.

Prepare written report and presentation slides.

Communicate results clearly, emphasizing business relevance and insights.

## Getting Started (for teammates)

### 1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
```sh
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Workflow Guidelines

- **Branching:** Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix.
- **Pull Requests:** Open a pull request for code review before merging to `main`.
- **Commits:** Use clear, descriptive commit messages.
- **.gitignore:** Do not commit your `venv` folder or data files.
- **requirements.txt:** After installing new packages, run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` and commit the changes.
